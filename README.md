# quest_02_sharkattacks

With the Shark Attack dataframe provided, I applied data cleaning techniques to be able to validate my hypothesis that people who identified as male that were more likely to get shark attacks.
--
The data cleaning techniques I applied are:
- Cleaned NaN values.
- Dropped (unseful) columns.
- Removed duplicates.
- Manipulated strings.
- Formatted the data.

And I've also applied EDA to create bar charts to prove my hypothesis.

Regarding the challenges and improvements:
- Comparing two columns with each other.
- Improved search counts to understand quantitative values.
- Get a better understanding of a more professionalized project delivery.
